# NREL FAST source with CMake build

This is a fork of the [NREL FAST v8](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST8)
source code to adapt it to use CMake for the build system. The source
formatting has been rearranged slightly, but otherwise no source files
have been modified from the base source downloadable at the NWTC
download portal.

# Installation instructions

1. Close the repository 

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd fast8/build
cmake ../src  # Or ccmake ../src for GUI configuration
make

```
